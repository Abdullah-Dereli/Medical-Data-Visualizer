# Medical Data Visualizer

Here are some example visualizations generated by the project:

![Categorical Plot](examples/Figure_1.png)  
*Categorical Plot comparing health indicators for patients with and without cardiovascular disease.*

![Heat Map](examples/Figure_2.png)  
*Heatmap showing correlations among medical measurements.*

## Project Overview

This project is a **Medical Data Visualizer** that analyzes and visualizes medical examination data using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. The dataset contains information collected from medical check-ups, including body measurements, blood test results, and lifestyle factors.

## What We Did

### Data Import & Cleaning  
- Imported the medical examination dataset (`medical_examination.csv`) using Pandas.  
- Cleaned the data by filtering out inconsistent entries (e.g., diastolic blood pressure higher than systolic, and extreme height/weight values).

### Feature Engineering  
- Added an `overweight` column by calculating the Body Mass Index (BMI) for each patient. Patients with BMI > 25 were labeled as overweight.

### Data Normalization  
- Converted categorical features like cholesterol and glucose levels into binary flags, where 0 indicates a normal/healthy level and 1 indicates an elevated/unhealthy level.

### Visualization  
- Created two main visualizations:  
  1. A **categorical plot** showing counts of various health indicators (cholesterol, glucose, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, overweight) separated by the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease.  
  2. A **heatmap** depicting correlations among the medical variables to identify relationships and patterns.

## How We Worked

- Used **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning.  
- Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** libraries for creating informative, publication-quality plots.  
- Applied data filtering and transformations to ensure meaningful visualizations.  
- Followed a structured approach by completing the project step-by-step according to the project requirements and tests.

## Purpose

This project aims to provide insights into how body measurements, blood test results, and lifestyle choices relate to cardiovascular disease risk. It demonstrates practical data analysis and visualization skills with real-world medical data.
